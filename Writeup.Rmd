It contains more than 3 million rows, which comprises 6629 artists, 18598 songs for a total count of one hundred five billion streams count.

The data spans from 1st January 2017 to 9th January 2018 and will be kept up-to-date on following versions. It has been collected from Spotify's regional chart data.

**Inspiration**

Can you predict what is the rank position or the number of streams a song will have in the future?
How long do songs "resist" on the top 3, 5, 10, 20 ranking?
What are the signs of a song that gets into the top rank to stay?
Do continents share same top ranking artists or songs?
Are people listening to the very same top ranking songs on countries far away from each other?
How long time does a top ranking song takes to get into the ranking of neighbor countries?

**Questions**

1) Do people listen to the same songs even if the country is far away from each other?
2) What is the most popular song based on region?
3) How long does a particular song stay in top 5/10/20?
4) Given a top ranking song in a particular region, how long before a neighboring country has the same song in its top rankings?
