Introduction

**Worldwide Spotify Music Streaming**

Music streaming is ubiquitous. Currently, Spotify plays an important part on 
that. However, we are very limited in what music we listen to based on where we 
are located, and different regions listen to completely different songs and even 
genres of music. We wanted to see how this differed across the globe.

In this project, we attempt to answer questions such as

* Do people listen to the same songs even if the country is far away from each
other?
* What is the most popular song based on region?
* How long does a particular song stay in top 5/10/20?
* How does the stream amount of a particular artist's song changed over time 
between two countries?

This dataset enables us to explore how artists and songs' popularity varies in 
time across the world. The dataset contains the daily ranking of the 200 most
listened songs in 53 countries from 2017 and 2018 by Spotify users. The original
dataset contained more than 3 million rows, which comprised of 6629 artists and 
18598 songs. However, this dataset was too large for us to deploy our 
application on shinyapps, so we subsetted the data and used the Top 30 most 
listened. Every row contains the song name, the position/ranking of the song, 
the artist, the number of streams, the URL, the date the data point was 
recorded, and the region. We wrote additional code to add columns for the month 
and the country.

Example Walkthrough
===

Overview map graph - 

Top songs (based on streams) - 

Top songs (based on days in top 5) - This graph is a bar chart showing the 
number of days that a song has been in the top 5. The user can select which 
region he/she would like to look at as well as the top n number of songs to 
appear on the graph. With this, we can see a number of things such as how many
days do the top songs stay at the top and whether this is different depending
on the region. 

Country vs region - 

Streaming over time (by region) - 

Streaming over time (compare two countries) - 

Streaming over time (artist on top 200 daily list) - 

Artist song proportions - Here we have a stacked bar chart that is filled with
the amount of streams a particular song has. All the songs that appear belong
to the artist selected and so we are able to see how much more popular one 
song is compared to another in that region. This graph can be useful as if 
shows a more in-depth view of how successful a particular artist is. From the 
previous graphs we might be able to tell that an artist has a total of x 
number of streams, but that only shows the total stream count. This graph allows
us to see specifically which of his songs comprise of the most streams.

Design Choices
===

Overview map graph - 

Top songs (based on streams) - 

Top songs (based on days in top 5) - As this graph only contained one variable,
it was logical to use a bar chart to effectively show the data. We flipped the
x and y axis so that the bars were horizontal so that the song name's would not
overlap with each other. 

Country vs region - 

Streaming over time (by region) - 

Streaming over time (compare two countries) - 

Streaming over time (artist on top 200 daily list) - 

Artist song proportions - We decided to use a stacked bar chart because we 
believed it would show not only the proportions, but also the specific stream
count. In addition, we added the plotly features so that the user can mouse
over a particular portion to see the exact amount of streams that portion 
accounts for. 

Appendix
===

Based on feedback we received, we revised various aspects of our draft app. Our
initial draft didn't really include any textual explanations of the graph,
and the user was left to form a story for him/herself. Adding a clear, 
multifaceted message or purpose while using graphs, interactions, and text to
support and answer the questions we wanted to explore gave users more of
an insight as to what we were doing and also allowed them to explore any
questions that might have had as well. We also changed our application to load 
all objects that we needed and pre-saved rather than process them everytime 
the application ran, speeding things up considerably. 

For the graphs that previously took in textual input, we changed these to become
alphabetically sorted dropdown selections. We did this because although the 
textual input is cool, the user doesn't actually know what songs or artists are
contained in the dataset. Doing this gives the user a much better experience so 
that they don't see 'No Results Found' all the time. We also added plotly to the
time series plots so that users could examine the points more and could really 
examine a specific time frame if they wanted.
